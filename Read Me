This will be were the code for the manual/mapping mode for the bot goes.

Purpose: Allow for the bot to be driven manualy as well as add a few functions to take gps data of the 
bots current position and heading to act as waypoints for autonomous mode.

To-Do List:
1. Make the controlls for the bot to go forward and back
2. Make the controlls for the bot to steer
3. Assign and code the button for printing the bots current gps coordinates to the brain for future use as waypoints
4. Assign a new or the same button used in step 3 to also give gps heading data for use in automonous mode
