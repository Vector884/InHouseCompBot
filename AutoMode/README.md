We need to use the coordinates taken in manual mode to give the bot waypoints to travel too.

To-Do List:
1. Adapt turning code so that the bot can face its next waypoint from its current position
2. Adapt movement code for the bot to go towards next waypoint
3. Have some sort of check to make the sure the bot remains on coarse and doesnt crash or otherwise, the distance sensors can help with this
4. Make a function that exicutes if the bot is to close or makes contact with a surface
