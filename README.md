# InHouseCompBot
Code for the in-house robotics club competition.

The plan for this bot is to use 3 distance sensors and a single gps tracker to navigate the school building.

Plan: After the bot is constructed, decide the min distance the bot can be from surfaces until corrective action is take. Also use gps tracker to gather coordinates and set waypoints for the turning points in the hallways. **Be aware of the pit when creating the path!**.
