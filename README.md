# InHouseCompBot
Code for the in-house robotics club competition.

The plan for this bot is to use 3 distance sensors and a single gps tracker to navigate the school building.

Plan: After the bot is constructed, decide the min distance the bot can be from surfaces until corrective action is take. Also use gps tracker to gather coordinates and set waypoints for the turning points in the hallways. **Be aware of the pit when creating the path!**.

Addendum 5/2/22: I have added 2 branches, one for autonomous mode and the other for the manual mode. In each respective branch will be a folder containing the "README" which explains the purpose of that branch and what has to be done in that respective code file. You can put whatever indicator you want to mark that something is done or leave it alone. Additionally I am removeing the quick ref as we should be working on the idle anyways, github is just a means to transfer files.
